Quill Engine v0.0.1

A Sonic platformer engine, built using Pygame, with Tiled level editor integration.

This project is still in early alpha! I have a lot of restructuring to do, and most of the physics are not yet working.

This project is under the MIT No Attribution license, no credits needed, but very appreciated.

All sprites and audios are property of Sega, and you can't use them for commercial purposes.
